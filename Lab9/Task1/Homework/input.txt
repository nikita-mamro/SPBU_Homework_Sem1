Cats
I promised to look after a friends cat for the week . My place has a glass atrium that goes through two levels , I have put the cat in there with enough food and water to last the week . I am looking forward to the end of the week . It is just sitting there glaring at me , it doesn't do anything else . I can tell it would like to kill me . If I knew I could get a perfect replacement cat , I would kill this one now and replace it Friday afternoon . As we sit here glaring at each other I have already worked out several ways to kill it .
The simplest would be to drop heavy items on it from the upstairs bedroom though I have enough basic engineering knowledge to assume that I could build some form of spear like projectile device from parts in the downstairs shed . If the atrium was waterproof , the most entertaining would be to flood it with water . It wouldn't have to be that deep , just deeper than the cat .
I don't know how long cats can swim but I doubt it would be for a whole week . If it kept the swimming up for too long I could always try dropping things on it as well . I have read that drowning is one of the most peaceful ways to die so really it would be a win win situation for me and the cat I think .
