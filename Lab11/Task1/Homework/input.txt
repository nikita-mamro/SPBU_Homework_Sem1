There was another door opposite to the locked one , which led , as Antony was to discover for himself directly , into a passage from which opened two more rooms . Cayley stepped into the passage , and opened the door on the right . The door from the office , through which he had gone , remained open . The door , at the end of the short passage was shut . Antony , kneeling by the body , followed Cayley with his eyes , and , after he had disappeared , kept his eyes on the blank wall of the passage , but he was not conscious of that at which he was looking , for his mind was with the other man , sympathizing with him .
